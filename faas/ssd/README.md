# The SSD example

Run SSD tensorflow models as functions.



## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, follow these simple instructions to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [ssvmup](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/ssvmup/).
until now, we don't have a high ACC model, so just leave the code for now.
notes: for above reason, DO NOT EXECUTE NEXT STEP.

## Build the WASM bytecode

```
$ ssvmup build --enable-aot --enable-ext
```
